    <p>"I am a junior studying Computer Science with minor in Statistics. I am from Surabaya, Indonesia. Fun fact, I changed my major from Neuroscience to Computer Science. One of the significant reasons behind it was that I got to know some cool CS major people from MATH128."</p>

    <h1>Description of Tools:</h1>
    <p>This project was divided into two sections.  The first part of the project consisted of creating a RESTful web server.  We used this to populate our table with the necessary data.  The second part of the project consisted of implemeting an interactive map using leaflet.  This map allows users to see where each neighborhood is with markers depicting how many crimes are within a certain range.  We also used the nominatim API to take user input and convert it to the corresponding address/latitude and longitude values.  Vue was used as the client-side framework in this project.</p>

    <h1>Six Interesting Facts:</h1>
    <p>1. From looking at the table, it seems more crimes happen at night.</p>
    <p>2. From looking at the map, it seems that Capitol River neighborhood and Thomas/Dale(Frogtown) neighborhood have recently been the crime hotspots in St. Paul.</p>
    <p>3. Proactive Police Visit seems to be the most common incident from looking at the table.</p>
    <p>4. The outer areas of St. Paul seems to have less crimes.</p>
    <p>5. On November 25th 2020, there were over 100 incidents.</p>
    <p>6. There were more narcotic incidents on November 22nd than on November 25th.</p>
